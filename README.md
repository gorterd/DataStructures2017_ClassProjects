## Data Structures (2017) - Class Projects

Contained in this repository are a few class projects I completed in the *Data Structures* course I took Winter 2017 at Carleton College, taught by [Dr. David Musicant](https://apps.carleton.edu/profiles/dmusicant/).

This course was based in Java, and its focus was on understanding common data structures (lists, heaps, hash tables, binary search trees, etc.) and their ideal use cases. In the beginning of the course, we created our own implementations of several built in Java data structures. Later in the course, we created programs (for encryption, search, sorting, etc.) with the data structures we had studied, creating our own implementations as well as using built-in Java implementations. We evaluated the pros and cons of different data structures and analyzed the complexity of our code. [Here is the course reading/assignment schedule.](https://www.cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dmusican/cs201/schedule.html)

Here is a brief description of the projects I have included. A detailed assignment is also included in each project's directory.

### Heap

### Changeling

### Binary Tree Search Engine
